    "- Pros: Simple to implement, very efficient\n",

    "**2. Machine learning (with variations in features used and models)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pros: Efficient, can make use of all features, finds linear and nonlinear contributions from features,\n",
    "- Cons: May require lots of data, may overfit if you are not careful, may not generalize to new domains\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Bottom-up Data Analytics Approach**\n",
    "- Pros: No labels required! \n",
    "- Cons: Very computationally expensive without further improvements (n!), same issues with data analytics approach with using extra features, still need test set to validate assumptions"
